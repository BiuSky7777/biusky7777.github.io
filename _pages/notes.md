Here are some notes, completed independently with the help of various online resources. I hope they can make life a bit easier for others like me by:
* Offering detailed and thorough proofs of seemingly trivial or well-known results.


[**Homotopy Group of a Loop Space**](https://github.com/BiuSky7777/biusky7777.github.io/blob/master/_projects/loop_space.pdf)
* Through *Loop-Suspension Adjunction*, the following relationship for the homotopy group of a loop space $\Omega X$ is established:
$$ \pi_{k+1}(X) = \pi_k(\Omega X).$$
This property implies that to determine the $k$-th homotopy group of $\Omega X$, it is sufficient to know the $(k+1)$-th homotopy group of $X$.
* Additionally, for an $n$-th loop space $\Omega^n X$, the homotopy group would be $\pi_{k+n}(X)$, derived by applying the Loop-Suspension Adjunction $n$ times.
