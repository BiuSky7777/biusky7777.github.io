[**Towards Physically-Consistent, Chaotic Spatiotemporal Dynamics with Echo State Networks**](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2964/article_199.pdf)\
* This study investigates the use of echo state networks (ESNs) for time-series forecasting in chaotic physics.
* We compare a basic ESN with two physics-informed variants on the Lorenz attractor and then test the ESN on a large-scale atmospheric model and a real-world weather dataset. 
* Results show that a well-tuned traditional ESN can outperform physics-informed methods. While the ESN accurately predicts the global evolution of atmospheric primitive equations over short periods (~67 hours), it struggles with real-world data.

[**Investigation of Area Law for Local Hamiltonians**](https://github.com/BiuSky7777/Reed2020-Thesis/blob/master/Paper/My_Final_College_Paper.pdf)\
* Implemented generic and RRG algorithms to find ground states of local Hamiltonians, including Heisenberg and AKLT models.
* Verified an area law for von Neumann entanglement entropy in the XXZ model for up to 14 qubits.
* Confirmed exponential Schmidt coefficient distribution up to 13 qubits and predicted the slope for 14 qubits, with discrepancies within 0.1.
